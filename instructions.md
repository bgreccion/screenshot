# Product Overview
Product Name: SmartMerge Screenshot Extension

Description:
SmartMerge is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the process of capturing screenshots in multiple ways and intelligently merging them into one cohesive image. Users can capture full-page, element-specific, viewport, and custom area screenshots, and then choose to either store them separately or automatically merge them. The merge functionality dynamically resizes each screenshot and pads smaller images with a white border to ensure a uniform, professional output—ideal for developers, designers, QA testers, and content creators.

Objectives:
- Simplify and enhance the screenshot capturing process within the browser.
- Automate the creation of composite images for documentation and presentation purposes.
- Offer an intuitive, fast, and reliable user experience through a lightweight extension.

Target Audience:
- Web developers and designers
- QA testers and documentation teams
- Content creators and digital marketers

Value Proposition:
- Time-Saving: Automates manual image editing tasks.
- Consistency: Provides standardized outputs by dynamically resizing and padding screenshots.
- Ease of Use: Integrated directly into the browser with a user-friendly interface.

# Core Functionalities
## Screenshot Capture Modes
- Full Page Screenshot: Captures the entire webpage, even parts that require scrolling.
- Element Screenshot: Captures a specific HTML element by selecting it on the page.
- Viewport Screenshot: Captures only the visible part of the webpage.
- Area Screenshot: Allows the user to define and capture a custom rectangular area.

## Merge & Formatting Features
- Automatic Merging: Option to combine multiple screenshots into one composite image.
- Dynamic Resizing: Each screenshot is resized dynamically to a common dimension. Smaller images receive a white border to match larger ones, ensuring a consistent look.
- Layout Options: Users can select from various layout configurations (e.g., grid, vertical, horizontal) for the merged output.
- Preview & Edit: Provide a preview mode with basic editing options (e.g., reposition, adjust border size/color) before finalizing the merged image.

## Saving, Exporting & Sharing
- Download Options: Allow users to download the screenshots individually or as a merged composite image.
- Cloud Storage Integration: (Optional future feature) Integrate with cloud services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for saving and sharing screenshots.
- History & Archive: Maintain a history of recent screenshots for quick access and re-use.

## User Interface & Experience
- Easy-to-Use Popup UI: A clean and minimalistic popup that provides quick access to capture and merge functions.
- Context Menu Integration: Right-click options to quickly capture specific elements or areas.
- Settings Panel: Options to customize capture defaults, merge behavior, and output formats.

# Documentation
## Libraries/Packages & Tools
Frontend/UI:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Core web technologies.
- React or Vanilla JS: Depending on complexity; React can be used if planning a dynamic and reactive UI.
- Chrome Extension APIs: For capturing tabs, interacting with the DOM, and managing extension actions.

Screenshot Capture & Manipulation:
- html2canvas: To capture DOM elements as images.
- Canvas API: For merging screenshots, dynamic resizing, and adding white borders.
- FileSaver.js: For facilitating file downloads.

Build Tools:
- Webpack/Rollup: For bundling the JavaScript code (if using a modern JS framework).
- Babel: For transpiling ES6+ code if needed.
- ESLint/Prettier: For code quality and formatting.

## Example Code Implementation
Below is a simplified example to demonstrate capturing an element and merging two images using the Canvas API.
```javascript
// Include html2canvas (either via a script tag or as an npm package)
import html2canvas from 'html2canvas';

function captureElement(selector) {
  const element = document.querySelector(selector);
  if (!element) {
    console.error('Element not found');
    return;
  }
  html2canvas(element).then(canvas => {
    // Convert canvas to image data
    const imgData = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
    // Display or store the captured image
    document.body.appendChild(canvas);
  }).catch(err => {
    console.error('Capture failed:', err);
  });
}

// Usage
captureElement('#targetElement');
```

Merging Two Images on a Canvas
```javascript
function mergeImages(imageDataArray, outputWidth, outputHeight) {
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  canvas.width = outputWidth;
  canvas.height = outputHeight;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  // Example layout: place images horizontally
  const imageCount = imageDataArray.length;
  const singleWidth = outputWidth / imageCount;

  imageDataArray.forEach((imgData, index) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = imgData;
    img.onload = () => {
      // Calculate resized dimensions while preserving aspect ratio
      const scale = singleWidth / img.width;
      const newWidth = img.width * scale;
      const newHeight = img.height * scale;
      const x = index * singleWidth + ((singleWidth - newWidth) / 2);
      const y = (outputHeight - newHeight) / 2;

      // Draw a white background for uniformity if image is smaller
      ctx.fillStyle = '#FFFFFF';
      ctx.fillRect(index * singleWidth, 0, singleWidth, outputHeight);

      // Draw the image
      ctx.drawImage(img, x, y, newWidth, newHeight);
    };
  });

  return canvas;
}

// Example usage: after capturing two images
const imgDataArray = [/* Data URL of image 1 */, /* Data URL of image 2 */];
const mergedCanvas = mergeImages(imgDataArray, 800, 600);
document.body.appendChild(mergedCanvas);

```
